It is required to write a C++ console program to generate the signature of the specified file.
The signature is generated as follows: the source file is divided into blocks of equal (fixed) length
(if the file size is not a multiple of the block size, the last fragment must be padded with zeros
to the full block size). For each block, the hash value of the function is calculated and added
to the output signature file in hex string format. The hash for each block is written on a new line.

Interface:
A command line that contains:
* Path to the input file.
* Path to the output file.
* Block size: from 512 B to 10 MB (default is 1 MB).

Requirements:
* The program must process files from 0 B to 128 GB in size.
* The program should consume no more than 1 GB of memory.
* The program must work under Windows and Linux.
* The program must use MD5 as a hash function.
* The storage type can be different: HDD, SSD, RAM Disk, network storage.
* The program should not have races and resource leaks.
* It is necessary to implement correct error handling - diagnostic information should be displayed.
* It is necessary to optimize the speed of the program as much as possible.
* It is not allowed to use third-party libraries like OpenMP, OpenCL, etc.
* It is not allowed to use memory-mapped files.
* The code should be readable, simple, neat. The program algorithm should be understandable without debugging.

Assumptions:
It is allowed to use the "boost" library.
